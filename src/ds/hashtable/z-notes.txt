HashMap does not preserve the order of the elements --> unordered map
there is ordered map also

HashSet
- stores only unique elements
- O(1) average time complexity

all are O(1) Average time complexity
set.contains(k)
set.add(k)
set.remove(k)

There are generally five ways of iterating over a Map in Java. In this article, we will discuss all of them and also look at their advantages and disadvantages.
First of all, we cannot iterate a Map directly using iterators, because Map are not Collection. Also before going further, you must know a little-bit about Map.Entry<K, V> interface.
Since all maps in Java implement Map interface, following techniques will work for any map implementation (HashMap, TreeMap, LinkedHashMap, Hashtable, etc.)
