Linked List
pros
- mainly used to store data efficiently,
- Array and Arraylist needs contiguous segments of memory to store, linked list can store at random memory location

cons
- access time is not O(1), it is O(n)
- we have to traverse from head node to do any operation

Note: do not update the head of the linkedList, copy it to another variable and use
head variable will always have the reference of starting node of linkedList,
another variable can be used to traverse through the node reference of linkedList


Insertion at front - O(1)
Insertion at tail  - O(1), with tail pointer
Delete at Front    - O(1)
Delete at Tail     - O(n), even with tail pointer
