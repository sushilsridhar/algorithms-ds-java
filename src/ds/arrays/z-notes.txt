Arrays
pros
- easy access
- mainly used because O(1) random access, reason - arrays stores elements in contiguous memory location

cons
- fixed size

Dynamic Arrays
pros
- Arrays size can be dynamic
- mainly used because O(1) random access, reason - arrays stores elements in contiguous memory location

cons
- if memory is available, but it is not contiguous, that memory is not used hence affecting space efficiency


To solve arrays,

1) use HashSet or HashMap
2) two pointer approach, where inserting into same array (in-place questions)
   one index for iterating, other for tracking the lastNonZeroElementIndex (or any requirement)


Array Techniques

1)Adding contribution of each and every element - finding the number of occurrence of one element in all subarrays, and adding them individually
2)Carry forward - carring the previous subarray sum to new subarray
3)Sliding window - for the new subarray, subtract the previous element to startindex and add the element of new end index
4)Two pointer - for removing duplicate element, using the same input array itself for processing, without extra space
5)Prefix Sum - for problems with queries, Add X to array, from startIndex to endIndex, eg 4-8, add 9 , 0-4, add 14
