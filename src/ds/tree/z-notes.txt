Trees

- have hierarchy
- all other data structures are linear, tree have hierarchy

Programming paradigm - recursion
observation - left sub tree and right sub tree are binary trees

Types

- Binary tree, can have 0,1,2 children , maximum two children

Traversal rule:
- Visit left sub tree, before right sub tree

1. root -> left -> right , called pre order traversal  (root first)
2. left -> root -> right , called in order traversal   (root middle)
3. left -> right -> root , called post order traversal (root last)


real world examples: computer folder directory, browser DOM
