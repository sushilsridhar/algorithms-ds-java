recursion

function calling itself
is a technique of solving a problem using smaller instance of the same given problem

smaller instance means sub problem

observations
- size keeps decreasing


3 steps for writing recursive code

- Assume that your code will work
- Main logic -> solve bigger problem using smaller sub problem (recursive equation)
- Termination/ Base condition -> decide this, when code should stop


should we consider the stack space in space complexity for recursion?
- YES

recursive code will always have space complexity compared to other approaches, check ImplementPowFunction in problem-solving

space complexity:
maximum size of the stack at any point of time
max height of the recursion tree
